            Analyze this pull request focusing on CRITICAL issues only. Keep feedback concise and actionable.

            PRIORITY CHECKS (report only if found):
            1. Logic & Functionality
               - Logic flaws or incorrect implementations
               - Missing edge cases (empty inputs, boundary conditions, None/Some variants)
               - Unhandled error paths or panics in production code
               - Backward compatibility issues with existing APIs/data formats

            2. Production Safety (multi-cluster deployment context)
               - Breaking changes that could fail during rolling updates
               - State migration issues between old/new versions
               - Race conditions or data consistency problems
               - Resource leaks (memory, file handles, connections)

            3. Database & Data Handling
               - SQL injection risks or unsafe query construction
               - N+1 query problems (queries in loops)
               - Missing indexes causing slow queries (check query patterns)
               - Missing or improper transaction boundaries
               - Database migrations: ensure backward compatibility, no data loss

            4. Performance & Efficiency
               - Blocking operations in async functions (sync I/O, CPU-intensive work)
               - Excessive memory allocations or large data structures
               - Sequential operations that should be parallel (use tokio::join!/select!)
               - Missing timeouts on external calls (HTTP, database, vLLM)
               - Connection pool exhaustion risks

            5. Rust-Specific Concerns
               - Unnecessary .clone() calls (suggest borrows/references instead)
               - Unsafe code without safety comments explaining invariants
               - Incorrect ownership patterns or lifetime issues
               - Improper error handling (unwrap/expect in library code)
               - Concurrency issues (Arc/Mutex misuse, data races)

            6. Code Quality
               - Poor modularity (functions >100 lines, god objects)
               - Unclear naming or missing documentation for public APIs
               - Violated Single Responsibility Principle
               - Security vulnerabilities (injection, hardcoded secrets)

            REVIEW STYLE:
            - List only CRITICAL issues that need fixing before merge
            - Use bullet points, be direct and specific
            - Provide code examples for suggested fixes when helpful
            - If no critical issues: approve with brief summary
            - Sign off with: ✅ (approved) or ⚠️ (issues found)

            Consult the repository's CLAUDE.md file (if present) for project-specific conventions.
